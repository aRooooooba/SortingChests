# Sorting Chests

## A Stardew Valley mod which helps you put the same item in different chests together to save space.

- Once your save is loaded, it will sort all the chests in all the locations.
- When something is put into or grabbed from a chest, it will be sorted.

During sorting, the same objects in different chests will be stacked together automatically.

Items with max stack size will not be taken into account - because we cannot stack into it anymore! But once it's not with max stack size, it will be sorted.

Supports [ChestsAnyWhere](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/518), [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063) and almost all the mods! (Because it's not a very complex mod...)

Shipping Bin isn't taken into consideration. You can safely put items into the shipping bin.

It only sort chests in the same location!
